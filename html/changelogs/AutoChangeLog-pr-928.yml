delete-after: true
changes:
  - rscdel: automated hydroponics tray remove_unfasten_wrench override (duplicate
      behavior, extra messages)
  - bugfix: prevent unanchored hydroponics trays from accepting plumbing reagents
  - bugfix: removed a use-after-delete caused by calling create_reagents twice in
      automated hydroponics trays, which broke plumbing
  - tweak: allow hydroponics trays to accept plumbing reagents from all directions
  - rscdel: remove tray rotations (sprite didn't update anyway, and was only necessary
      for plumbing)
